make model of elevator
	- should accurately model correspondence between the input to the DC motor
	  and the speed of the elevator (as measured by the sensor)

make driver blocks x
	-using matlab system object?
		-sensor x
		-motor x

take measurements
	-read distances from file
	-make model to read distances
	-make model to test speeds and thresholds

make actual controller
	-make it stop when emergency button is pressed
		-make emergency led light up
		-make it start again after
			-continue what it was doing or go to nearest floor?
			-kill light
	-when stopped at floor
		-make door led light up
		-wait >5 sec
		-light must be off before moving again
	-make it run smoothly
		-limit speed and acceleration
	-make it robust to faults
		-check if delta(dsens) is too high
		-estimate actual position p with integral(k*u) + dstart, u=output speed for dc motor
			-need to get estimate of actual distance traveled as it corresponds 
			to dc motor speed up/down (find k)
	-make algorithm for floor planning

write report
	-describe overall design effort
		-what decisions were made for each part
			-models
			-driver block
				-motor
				-sensor
	-describe procedure of producing a model of the motor-elevator behaviour
	 (simulink model?)

prep demo
	-log and save inputs and outputs
		-presumably it should be run plugged in to computer (not external mode)
	-apply those inputs to simulink model and compare simulated outputs to real
